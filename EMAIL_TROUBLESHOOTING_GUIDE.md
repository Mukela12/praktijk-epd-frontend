# Email Verification Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary
The backend logs show that verification emails are being sent successfully, but you're not receiving them. This guide will help you troubleshoot the issue.

## Backend Logs Analysis
From your logs, we can see:
- ✅ Verification emails are being sent by the backend
- ✅ Email service is configured and responding
- ✅ Each registration triggers an email send

Example log entries:
```
✅ Verification email sent to jessekatungu@gmail.com
✅ Verification email sent to codelibrary21@gmail.com
```

## Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folders
**Most Common Issue**: Verification emails often end up in spam folders.

**Action Steps**:
1. Check the Spam/Junk folder for all email accounts:
   - mukela.j.katungu@gmail.com
   - jessekatungu@gmail.com
   - codelibrary21@gmail.com
2. If found in spam, mark as "Not Spam" to train your email filter
3. Add the sender email to your contacts/safe sender list

### 2. Gmail-Specific Issues
Since all accounts are Gmail accounts:

**Check Gmail Filters**:
1. Go to Gmail Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
2. Ensure no filters are blocking emails from the backend domain
3. Check the "All Mail" folder (emails might skip inbox)

**Gmail Security**:
1. Check if "Less secure app access" is affecting delivery
2. Review any security notifications in your Gmail account

### 3. Email Service Configuration (Backend)

**Possible Backend Issues**:
1. **SMTP Configuration**: The backend might be using a development SMTP service
2. **Email Domain Reputation**: If using a new domain, emails might be filtered
3. **Rate Limiting**: Too many emails sent quickly might trigger spam filters

**Backend Environment Variables to Check**:
```env
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
SMTP_FROM=
SMTP_FROM_NAME=
```

### 4. Email Content Issues

**Common Problems**:
- Email contains spam trigger words
- Missing or incorrect SPF/DKIM records
- HTML formatting issues
- Links in email triggering spam filters

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Test with Alternative Email
Try registering with a non-Gmail email address to see if it's Gmail-specific:
- Outlook/Hotmail
- Yahoo
- ProtonMail
- Company email

### 2. Check Backend Email Service
Ask your backend developer to:
1. Verify SMTP credentials are correct
2. Check email service logs (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
3. Ensure production email service is configured (not using development/sandbox mode)
4. Check if emails are bouncing back

### 3. Manual Verification (Temporary Solution)
While troubleshooting, you can manually verify accounts in the database:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET email_verified = true, 
    email_verified_at = NOW() 
WHERE email IN (
    'mukelajkatungu@gmail.com',
    'jessekatungu@gmail.com', 
    'codelibrary21@gmail.com'
);
```

## Frontend Improvements Needed

### 1. Add Resend Verification Email Feature
The frontend should have a "Resend Verification Email" button on the login page when a user with unverified email tries to log in.

### 2. Better Error Messages
Show more specific error messages when login fails due to unverified email.

### 3. Email Delivery Status
Consider adding a status page or notification that shows:
- Email sent successfully from backend
- Expected delivery time
- Troubleshooting tips

## Testing Email Delivery

### Quick Test Script
You can test email delivery directly:

```javascript
// test-email.js
const axios = require('axios');

async function testEmail() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://praktijk-epd-b0b63a5df9f4.herokuapp.com/api/auth/resend-verification', {
      email: 'your-test-email@example.com'
    });
    console.log('Email test result:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Email test failed:', error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

testEmail();
```

## Long-term Solutions

1. **Implement Email Webhooks**: Track email delivery status
2. **Use Transactional Email Service**: Services like SendGrid, Mailgun provide better deliverability
3. **Add Email Preview**: Let admins preview emails before sending
4. **Implement Email Logs**: Store email send attempts and status in database
5. **Add Alternative Verification**: SMS or manual admin verification

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Check spam folders for all three email accounts
2. **If not in spam**: Contact backend developer to check email service logs
3. **Alternative**: Use manual database verification to unblock testing
4. **Long-term**: Implement proper email monitoring and alternative verification methods

## Contact for Backend Support
If emails are not in spam and the issue persists:
1. Check with your backend hosting provider (Railway)
2. Review backend email service configuration
3. Check if there are any email service quotas or limits
4. Verify domain DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
