4. **Smart Pairing**: Validate recommendation algorithm with various client scenarios
5. **Resource Assignment**: Test multi-client assignment and tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time WebSocket connections for notifications

3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create comprehensive analytics for admin overview
4. **Export Functionality**: Add data export for reports and analysis
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement more sophisticated filtering options across all management screens

## Notes

- All components follow the inline design pattern without modals
