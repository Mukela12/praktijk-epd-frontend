# Billing Integration Summary

## Analysis Completed

I have thoroughly reviewed the frontend and backend billing implementations and documented the following:

### 1. Frontend Billing Endpoint Analysis
**File**: `FRONTEND_BILLING_ENDPOINT_ANALYSIS.md`
- Identified all billing-related endpoints in the frontend
- Found mismatches between frontend and backend endpoints
- Listed missing billing features in the frontend
- Provided endpoint mapping corrections

**Key Findings**:
- Frontend uses incorrect endpoint paths (missing `/api` prefix)
- Many billing features are not implemented in frontend
- Payment method endpoints need path corrections
- No session billing UI implementation

### 2. Backend Billing Endpoints Documentation
**File**: `BACKEND_BILLING_ENDPOINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Complete documentation of all backend billing endpoints
- Request/response formats for each endpoint
- Authentication requirements
- Validation rules and error responses

**Available Features**:
- Treatment code management
- Session billing submission
- Client billing preferences
- Immediate payment (Pay Now)
- SEPA payment methods
- Monthly invoice generation
- Admin billing controls

### 3. Frontend Implementation Plan
**File**: `FRONTEND_BILLING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Detailed 4-phase implementation plan
- Code changes needed for each component
- New components to be created
- Testing requirements

**Implementation Phases**:
1. **Phase 1**: Fix existing endpoints (1 week)
2. **Phase 2**: Session billing features (1 week)
3. **Phase 3**: Client payment features (1 week)
4. **Phase 4**: Admin invoice generation (1 week)

## Critical Changes Needed

### In realApi.ts
1. Update all billing endpoints to include `/api` prefix
2. Add missing billing endpoints:
   - Session billing submission
   - Client preferences
   - Immediate payment
   - Admin functions

### In endpoints.ts
1. Fix client invoice endpoints to use `/api/payments/client/invoices`
2. Fix payment method endpoints to include `/api/payments` prefix

### New Components Required
1. `SessionBillingForm.tsx` - For therapists to bill after sessions
2. `ClientBillingPreferences.tsx` - For payment settings
3. `PayNowButton.tsx` - For immediate payments
4. `AdminInvoiceGenerator.tsx` - For monthly billing

## Existing Components to Update
1. `TreatmentCodesManagement.tsx` - Fix API endpoint paths
2. `ClientInvoices.tsx` - Use correct invoice endpoints
3. `PaymentMethods.tsx` - Fix payment method endpoints
4. `AppointmentDetail.tsx` - Add billing step after completion

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. Test all endpoint connections with Railway backend
2. Verify Moneybird integration works
3. Test Mollie payment flow
4. Verify role-based access control

### After Deployment
1. Monitor billing submission success rate
2. Track payment completion rates
3. Verify invoice generation works monthly
4. Check webhook processing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Update realApi.ts with correct endpoints
   - Fix existing component API calls
   - Test with Railway backend

2. **Short Term** (1-2 weeks):
   - Implement session billing UI
   - Add billing to appointment workflow
   - Create client payment preferences

3. **Medium Term** (3-4 weeks):
   - Implement admin invoice generation
   - Add immediate payment features
   - Create billing dashboards

## Environment Configuration

Ensure these are set in the frontend `.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://praktijk-epd-backend-production.up.railway.app/api
VITE_ENABLE_BILLING=true
VITE_ENABLE_IMMEDIATE_PAYMENT=true
VITE_ENABLE_SEPA=true
```

## Success Criteria

✅ All billing endpoints properly connected  
✅ Therapists can submit billing after sessions  
✅ Clients can manage payment preferences  
✅ Immediate payments work via Mollie  
✅ Monthly invoices generate automatically  
✅ All roles have appropriate billing access
