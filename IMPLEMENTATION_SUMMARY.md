## Key Implementation Notes

### Production Endpoint Compliance
All implementations now use only working production endpoints:
- Removed mock data from AllTherapists component (requires backend endpoint)
- Removed completion survey feature (endpoint returns 500 error)
- Multiple therapist selection simplified to show only assigned therapist
- All other features use verified working endpoints from test results

### Backend Endpoint Requirements
For full feature implementation, the following endpoints would be needed:
1. `/client/available-therapists` - Get all therapists a client can book with
2. `/client/completion-survey` - Submit client completion feedback
3. `/admin/smart-pairing/auto-assign` - Automatically assign therapist based on city/availability

### Features Requiring Backend Support
1. **All Therapists View**: Currently shows empty state with guidance
2. **Multiple Therapist Selection**: Shows only assigned therapist
3. **Automatic Assignment**: Requires smart pairing endpoint access

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test invoice viewing with different invoice statuses
2. Verify €300 booking restriction works correctly
3. Test challenge filters with various combinations
4. Ensure therapist grid loads properly with real data
5. Check unpaid invoice modal behavior on dashboard
6. Verify all navigation links work correctly

## Notes for Production

- The therapist grid currently uses some mock data for demonstration
- Ensure backend exposes therapist list endpoint for clients
- Invoice PDF generation requires backend implementation
- Translation keys need to be added for new features
