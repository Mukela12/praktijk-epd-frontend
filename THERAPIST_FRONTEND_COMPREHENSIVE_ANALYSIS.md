2. Client appears in therapist's active clients count
3. Appointment requests from client show in therapist's queue
4. Therapist can create appointments directly

// Key Integration Points
- No direct hulpvragen display on dashboard (missed opportunity)
- Client assignment notification system
- Appointment status workflow management
```

#### Issues Found: 
- **⚠️ Missing Hulpvragen Context**: Dashboard doesn't show client hulpvragen summary
- **⚠️ No Smart Pairing Info**: Doesn't display why clients were matched to therapist

---

### 2. 🟡 ProfessionalTherapistClients Component - **CLIENT MANAGEMENT**
**File**: `src/pages/roles/therapist/clients/ProfessionalTherapistClients.tsx`  
**Route**: `/therapist/clients`  
**Status**: ⚠️ Functional but Missing Hulpvragen Integration

#### API Integration Analysis:
- **realApiService.therapist.getClients()**: ✅ Fetches therapist's assigned clients
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Comprehensive error handling for various HTTP status codes
- **Data Loading**: ✅ Clean loading states and empty state handling
- **Search & Filter**: ✅ Client-side filtering implementation

#### UI/UX Quality Assessment:
- **✅ Professional Client Cards**: Clean design with profile photos and status badges
- **✅ Statistics Overview**: Total clients, active clients, sessions, progress metrics
- **✅ Search Functionality**: Real-time client search by name/email
- **✅ Status Filtering**: Filter clients by active/inactive/on-hold/completed
- **✅ Empty State**: Informative guidance for therapists without clients

#### Core Functionality:
```typescript
// Client Display System
- Client cards with profile photos (ProfilePhotoUpload component)
- Status badges (active, inactive, on-hold, completed)
- Email and contact information display
- View Details navigation to individual client

// Statistics Panel
- Total Clients count
- Active Clients tracking
- Total Sessions (TODO - not implemented)
- Average Progress (TODO - not implemented)

// Search & Filter
- Real-time search by name or email
- Status filtering with dropdown
- Manual refresh capability
```

#### Critical Missing Features:
```typescript
// ❌ MISSING HULPVRAGEN INTEGRATION
- No display of client's selected hulpvragen
- No indication of why client was matched to therapist
- No expertise match percentage shown
- No treatment focus areas visible

// ❌ MISSING SESSION DATA
- Session count shows as 0 (TODO comment)
- Last session date not tracked
- Progress tracking not implemented
- No integration with session notes
```

#### Backend Integration Issues:
- **❌ Incomplete Data Model**: Client type doesn't include hulpvragen field
- **❌ Missing Session Integration**: No session count or history data
- **❌ No Progress Tracking**: Progress calculation not implemented

---

### 3. 🔴 ClientPsychologicalBehavior Component - **DISCONNECTED FROM HULPVRAGEN**
**File**: `src/pages/roles/therapist/clients/ClientPsychologicalBehavior.tsx`  
**Route**: `/therapist/clients/:id/psychological-behaviors`  
**Status**: ❌ Mock Implementation - Not Connected to Hulpvragen System

#### Critical Analysis:
This component appears to be a **parallel system** to hulpvragen that is:
- **❌ Using mock data** instead of real API calls
- **❌ Not integrated** with the hulpvragen selected during booking
- **❌ Creating duplicate** psychological tracking system
- **❌ No connection** to appointment_requests.hulpvragen data

#### Mock Implementation Issues:
```typescript
// MOCK DATA ONLY - No Real Integration
- Mock client data hardcoded
- Mock assignments with fake IDs
- availableBehaviors array hardcoded
- No API calls to backend
- TODO comments throughout
```

#### Architectural Confusion:
This component suggests a **major architectural issue**:
1. Clients select hulpvragen during booking
2. Admin uses hulpvragen for AI matching
3. But therapists use a completely different "psychological behaviors" system
4. No data flow between hulpvragen → psychological behaviors

**Recommendation**: This component should be refactored to display and work with the actual hulpvragen data from appointment_requests.

### 4. 🟢 SessionNoteForm Component - **PROFESSIONAL SESSION DOCUMENTATION**
**File**: `src/pages/roles/therapist/notes/SessionNoteForm.tsx`  
**Route**: `/therapist/notes/new` & `/therapist/notes/:id/edit`  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready - But Missing Hulpvragen Context

#### API Integration Analysis:
- **therapistApi.getClients()**: ✅ Loads therapist's clients for selection
- **therapistApi.getAppointments()**: ✅ Fetches appointments for linking
- **therapistApi.getSessionNote()**: ✅ Loads existing notes for editing
- **therapistApi.createSessionNote/updateSessionNote**: ✅ Save functionality

#### Professional Features:
```typescript
// Comprehensive Session Documentation
- Client and appointment selection
- Session type and duration tracking
- Mood tracking (before/after with 1-5 scale)
- Key points documentation (dynamic list)
- Interventions used (dynamic list)
- Homework assignments (dynamic list)
- Progress notes (detailed text)
- Private notes (therapist-only)
- Tag system for categorization
- Important flag for critical sessions
```

#### Missing Hulpvragen Integration:
- **❌ No Hulpvragen Display**: Doesn't show client's original concerns
- **❌ No Progress Linking**: Can't track progress against specific hulpvragen
- **❌ Disconnected Documentation**: Session notes don't reference treatment goals
