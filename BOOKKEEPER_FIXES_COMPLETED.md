# Bookkeeper Interface Fixes - Completion Summary

## Overview
All critical issues in the bookkeeper interface have been successfully resolved. The system is now fully functional with proper backend integration and professional UI.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 403 Errors - BookkeeperMessages Endpoint
**Problem**: BookkeeperMessages was allegedly using `/client/messages` endpoint causing 403 errors
**Solution**: Verified that BookkeeperMessages was already correctly using `useBookkeeperMessages()` hook which calls `/bookkeeper/messages`
**Status**: No fix needed - was already correct

### 2. ✅ TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getAll')
**Problem**: InvoiceManagement and Reports components were calling `realApiService.invoices.getAll()` which doesn't exist
**Solution**: 
- Changed all occurrences to `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
- Fixed in: InvoiceManagement.tsx, Reports.tsx, Dashboard.tsx, FinancialDashboard.tsx
**Status**: FIXED

### 3. ✅ Replaced Popup Modals with Inline Views
