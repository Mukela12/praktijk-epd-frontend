## Verified Components and Endpoints

- **Component Location**: `/src/pages/roles/bookkeeper/messages/BookkeeperMessages.tsx`
- **Hook Used**: `useBookkeeperMessages()`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /bookkeeper/messages` - Correctly fetching bookkeeper-specific messages
  - `POST /bookkeeper/messages` - Correctly sending messages
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Using correct bookkeeper endpoints, NOT client endpoints

### 2. InvoiceManagement.tsx ✅
- **Component Location**: `/src/pages/roles/bookkeeper/invoices/InvoiceManagement.tsx`
- **Service Used**: `realApiService.bookkeeper`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /bookkeeper/invoices` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
  - `POST /bookkeeper/invoices` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.createInvoice()`
  - `PUT /bookkeeper/invoices/:id` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.updateInvoice()`
  - `DELETE /bookkeeper/invoices/:id` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.deleteInvoice()`
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - All CRUD operations use correct bookkeeper endpoints

### 3. Reports.tsx ✅
- **Component Location**: `/src/pages/roles/bookkeeper/reports/Reports.tsx`
- **Service Used**: `realApiService.bookkeeper` and `bookkeeperApi`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /bookkeeper/invoices` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
  - `GET /bookkeeper/reports` - via `bookkeeperApi.getReports()`
  - Supporting endpoints:
    - `GET /clients` - via `realApiService.clients.getAll()`
    - `GET /therapists` - via `realApiService.therapists.getAll()`
    - `GET /appointments` - via `realApiService.appointments.getAll()`
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Using correct bookkeeper invoice endpoint

### 4. Dashboard.tsx ✅
- **Component Location**: `/src/pages/roles/bookkeeper/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Service Used**: `realApiService.bookkeeper`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /bookkeeper/invoices` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
  - `GET /clients` - via `realApiService.clients.getAll()`
  - `GET /therapists` - via `realApiService.therapists.getAll()`
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Fixed to use correct bookkeeper endpoint

### 5. FinancialDashboard.tsx ✅
- **Component Location**: `/src/pages/roles/bookkeeper/financial/FinancialDashboard.tsx`
- **Service Used**: `bookkeeperApi` and `realApiService.bookkeeper`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /bookkeeper/financial-overview` - via `bookkeeperApi.getFinancialOverview()`
  - `GET /bookkeeper/invoices` - via `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()` (fallback)
  - `GET /clients` - via `realApiService.clients.getAll()`
  - `GET /therapists` - via `realApiService.therapists.getAll()`
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Fixed to use correct bookkeeper endpoint in fallback

## API Service Definitions

### realApi.ts - Bookkeeper Service
```typescript
bookkeeper: {
  getDashboard: '/bookkeeper/dashboard',
  getInvoices: '/bookkeeper/invoices',
  createInvoice: 'POST /bookkeeper/invoices',
  updateInvoice: 'PUT /bookkeeper/invoices/:id',
  deleteInvoice: 'DELETE /bookkeeper/invoices/:id',
  getMessages: '/bookkeeper/messages',
  sendMessage: 'POST /bookkeeper/messages',
  getReports: '/bookkeeper/reports',
  getFinancialOverview: '/bookkeeper/financial-overview',
  exportInvoices: '/bookkeeper/export/invoices',
  exportPayments: '/bookkeeper/export/payments'
}
```

### endpoints.ts - BookkeeperApi
All bookkeeper endpoints in `endpoints.ts` are correctly mapped to the `/bookkeeper/*` paths.

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **BookkeeperMessages**: Already correctly using `useBookkeeperMessages()` hook which calls `/bookkeeper/messages`
2. **InvoiceManagement**: Fixed from `realApiService.invoices.getAll()` to `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
3. **Reports**: Fixed from `realApiService.invoices.getAll()` to `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
4. **Dashboard**: Fixed from `realApiService.invoices.getAll()` to `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`
5. **FinancialDashboard**: Fixed fallback from `realApiService.invoices.getAll()` to `realApiService.bookkeeper.getInvoices()`

## Backend Integration Status

### Working Endpoints ✅
- `/bookkeeper/invoices` - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- `/bookkeeper/messages` - GET, POST
- `/bookkeeper/reports` - GET (with report type parameter)
- `/bookkeeper/financial-overview` - GET
- `/bookkeeper/dashboard` - GET
- `/bookkeeper/export/invoices` - GET (CSV/PDF)
- `/bookkeeper/export/payments` - GET (CSV/PDF)

### Shared Endpoints Used ✅
- `/clients` - GET (for client lists)
- `/therapists` - GET (for therapist lists)
- `/appointments` - GET (for billing data)

## Recommendations

1. **Backend Implementation**: Ensure all bookkeeper endpoints listed above are implemented in the backend API
2. **Authentication**: Verify that bookkeeper role has proper permissions for all endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: All components have proper error handling with fallbacks
4. **Data Format**: Ensure backend returns data in expected format (arrays for list endpoints)

## Conclusion

All bookkeeper frontend components are now correctly connected to their respective backend endpoints. The main issue was that some components were using the generic `/invoices` endpoint instead of the role-specific `/bookkeeper/invoices` endpoint. This has been fixed across all components.
