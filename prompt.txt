Glad you like it, let us know your feedback. We are still working on payment and other issues

In the therapist role appointment had a glitch
Noted it‚Äôs something to do with the backend errors because i‚Äôm still updating the backend
Also we need to work on messaging
Because it‚Äôs not real time currently
from the therapist role: they can add specializations. Would it be posscile that the admin creat the names and the therapist can choose beween the options. This gives a universal look to clients. Can we rename specialization to therapies (Therapie√´n)? and add a section of option with what psychologicol problems (hulpvragen) a therapist can help. like ADD, concentration problems etc. Also admin needs to create this list and therapist can choose.
The therapist setting is not yet completed right?
Noted
No, not yet
If you find any other issues or changes you want please let me know üôè
The my profile section was glitching as well.
