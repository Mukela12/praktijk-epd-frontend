## 9. CONCLUSION

The PraktijkEPD system has made significant progress with core functionality implemented for Admin and Therapist roles. The UI is professional and consistent, following the no-modal requirement. However, several critical features remain incomplete, particularly for Client, Assistant, and Bookkeeper roles.

**Overall Completion Status: ~65%**

**Production Readiness: NOT READY**
- Critical features missing
- Build errors need fixing
- Backend endpoints incomplete
- Testing incomplete

**Recommended Action:**
Focus on completing Phase 1 priorities to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP) that can handle basic operations for all user roles.
