Hello, I hope everything is going well with you.
I have already gone through the client side of the platform, and overall it looks very good. Here are some points of feedback:
Translation (EN/NL): Some of the English–Dutch translations are not entirely accurate and some fucntions are not working.
Delete Account: This option should not be available under Dutch law and must be removed.
Messages Section: This looks good. Could we add a survey that is triggered when the therapist marks the client as “completed”? This way, we can automatically collect overall feedback and ratings.
Resources: These look fantastic.
Challenges: Also very good. The only suggestion is to add a filter option.
Payments & Invoices: At first glance, this looks good. I have net yet seen the incoice self, i would love to see this.
My Therapist: Could we add a full list/grid of all therapists in our team here, so that clients can book another therapist for themselves if needed?
My Appointments: When multiple therapists are linked to a client, it would be useful if the client could choose which therapist to book with. The therapy type should also be linked to the therapist’s offered modalities.
Agenda: Currently not working.
Dashboard: Looks good.
Additional Workflow Request:
When a client registers for the first time, they should immediately be able to schedule a session with the therapist and location of their choice.
In the same window, after entering their email and chosen password, they should automatically be directed to their personal file.
The first step in this file is an intake form that must be completed (linked to the therapist).
Once therapy starts and the therapist books the first session, the client should receive a notification to complete their personal details. Upon opening their file, this form should be presented automatically.
After completing the basic details, the client must agree to the contracts (linked to the therapist) and set up their SEPA direct debit as the default payment method. (As a small alternative, the client can choose manual invoice creation.)
Workflow for sessions: when a session is booked, the system should allow immediate payment, up until the official invoice is sent by us.
If an invoice remains unpaid, it should automatically pop up when the client logs in. After 30 days, this popup should remain visible until payment is made.
Default rule: clients may have a maximum of €300 in unpaid invoices. If they exceed this, they cannot schedule new sessions until payment is completed. Only an admin should be able to adjust this default limit.

[13:43, 19/08/2025] Katungu Mukela: Btw @+31 6 14062970, the back end works so that the therapist is assigned a client by the admin is thay correct?
[13:44, 19/08/2025] Katungu Mukela: So if a client books an appointment and they are a new client
[13:45, 19/08/2025] Katungu Mukela: They will be assigned a therapist by the admin
[13:45, 19/08/2025] Katungu Mukela: Is that okay?
[20:52, 19/08/2025] +31 6 14062970: If possible can the client be automaticalky assigned to therapist as soon as a client books appointments filtered by city and therapist name?  It takes me a lot of work do hand assign each client to therapist
[20:53, 19/08/2025] +31 6 14062970: Only when not in the system yet. So PraktijkEPD is for now clients as well as old clients
