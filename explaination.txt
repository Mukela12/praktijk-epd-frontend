great now i want you to handle the therapist's my appointment screen appropriately make sure to  make a professional design that let's the therapist know that they haven't been assigned a client  and will be assigned a client by the adminitrator, also please make sure the admin is able to see all users on the platform and is able to assign therapists to clients once a client is assigned to a therapist both the client and the therapists get a notification showing that they have been assigned a therapist, the admin should also be able to view session progress for each client and therapist this means that the admin can see the number of session they have booked


Functions that should be possible:

Assignment:

The admin should be able to assign a client to a therapist, when a client clicks book a session they should be provided with a form to fill in the date and time they want the appointment to be and their problems etc, if they already had a therapist assigned to them before they can book another appointment with that therapists again this time the admin won’t need to assign them a therapist, if it’s their first time or they didn’t select to have a session with their previous therapist(s) then when they book a session without selecting a preferred therapist then the admin will see their booking request and assign them a therapist based on the client’s submission. Once the admin assigns the client to a therapist both are supposed to receive a notification in their web app to show them that they have been assigned, the therapist and client will both be able to see their appointment dates in their calendar and will see a notification that they have a new appointment keep in mind the admin can only be able to assign therapists that are free based on the client’s submitted appointment suchedule, if the client wants to book another session with their previous therapist they should be able to see the available slots for that particular therapist and select a time then book a session once a session is booked by the client the therapist will be able to see all appointments as a list and in their calendar. The therapist should be able to see more details about their clients after submission and they can perform other operations like assigning the client a survey to fill in (the therapist creates the survey, can edit the survey and delete the survey as well as the admin because the admin can see the surveys assigned to clients from therapists) which the client will be able to see a notification about and see an email to alert them that they have been assigned a survey the therapist should be able to see if the client has answered the survey or not and if they answer the survey the therapist should be able to see the details of their answer and be able to export their answers into a text file. The admin will be able to see the surveys that a therapist assigned to a client and if they have been answered or not. The therapist should also be able to do the same with challenges these should be tasks that the client can do to help them with their problem these challenges are short things they would advise their client on doing this means things like take 5 minutes a day to be thankful about … or breathing challenge the time set by the therapist e.g 10 minutes a day would be fixed for a client, this means a client should be able to check-in and get timed as they do that task e.g if they need to take 10 minutes out of their day to say some graditudes then when the client see the challenge on their side they should be able to check-in everyday to make sure they are performing that challenge and they will be timed this means when they start the challenge there will be a countdown let’s say if the challenge is 10 minutes a day then a countdown should start for ten minutes when the user checks-in on their challenge and what they are supposed to do in detail. The client should also be able to see and answer the surveys assigned to them. The admin should be able to create/edit/delete and assign resources to clients one a client is assign a resource they should receive a notification and can be able to read that resource by clicking on it think of resources like articles they can read to help them keep in mind the admin can decide to make the resources public or private this means if they are public all clients can see them but on the client side they should be able to see if it’s a public resource or a resource assigned to them only to go through. The therapist should be able to see the history of surveys and challenges they have assigned to a particular client so that they know not to assign the same client the same resource again. 



Profile edits:

The admin should be able to edit the therapist’s profile and the client’s profile, they will be able to remove users from the platform, suspend some users, active some user (accounts) etc, the admin will also be able to assign/create accounts to roles like assistant, bookkeeper and therapist these will be users. The admin should be able to approve address change of the client this means when a client wants to change their address of bank account number they should be approved by the admin first. 
The therapist should be able to edit the at most five type of specializations they have, this can also be edited by the admin, this is important to the admin because they will be able to categorize therapists by their specializations too. 
The clients can be assigned psychological behaviour by the therapist after a couple of sessions these behaviours will only be visible by the admin and therapist these behavours will allow the admin to categorize clients based on the psychological behaviour. I want you to first understand how sessions work before implementing this

Sessions: 

Each time a client and a therapist have a session then a session is considered to have begun the therapist will be able to check-in at the start of the appointment if the client has arrived for the session or not a client present check once the therapists approves that the client has arrived then the session begins if not then the session will not start, keep in mind that a session can only begin from an appointment this means the therapist should be able to cancel any appointment and reschedule an existing appointment. A session will be tracked this means once the therapist has approved the session which means it took place the admin will be able to see the session to and the duration of the session as well as the surveys and challenges the therapist could have assigned the client after each session. The payment system will be attached to the sessions this means that a session can only start while paid for but for now because the payment system isn’t fully ready you can just make sure the full session works without the payment system in place yet. 

Smart pairing system:

The admin will have a smart paring system that will be able to recommend therapists that are available in that time slot the client submitted and the ones that closest match the client’s problem. I want you to keep in mind that when a client is submitting their
